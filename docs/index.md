# Welcome to py-load-eudravigilance

`py-load-eudravigilance` is a high-performance, extensible, and robust Python package for the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) of EudraVigilance Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs).

Its primary objective is to migrate data from the complex, hierarchical ICH E2B(R3) XML format into structured relational databases, optimized for analytical consumption and auditing.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Performance:** To process large volumes (millions) of ICSRs efficiently by utilizing the native bulk loading mechanisms of the target database.
2.  **Accuracy:** To accurately parse and map the E2B(R3) standard, ensuring data fidelity and correctly handling ICSR versioning.
3.  **Extensibility:** To provide a cloud-agnostic and database-agnostic architecture that facilitates easy integration with various data warehouses.
4.  **Robustness:** To ensure data integrity through transactional processing and idempotency.
